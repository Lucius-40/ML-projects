In this repository , I have included all the projects that I have done to grasp the basic concepts of machine learning like Linear regression , Logistic regression and so on .Some of the projects also have extensive 
data pre-processiing pipelines. Furthermore , I have tried to implement linear regression on my own using gradient descendt.
